I've developed a dynamic web project with Java, C, MySQL, Hibernate, and Thymeleaf, managing a car website. Users easily add cars, search, and apply filters for a seamless experience. Java ensures robust backend functionality, integrating smoothly with MySQL through Hibernate for efficient data processing. Thymeleaf facilitates a user-friendly interface for adding cars, while the search and flexible filtering system enhance the browsing experience. In summary, the project efficiently integrates technologies, providing a tailored and user-friendly platform for car management.
